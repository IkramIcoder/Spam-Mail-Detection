# 📧 Spam Mail Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting **spam emails** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning techniques**. It classifies emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam) based on their content, making use of common text-processing and classification methods.

The model is trained on labeled email data and can be used as a core component for email filtering systems.
